# Readme

This is a Seamful Game Based on GPS Shadows. It was my fourth year project at the University of Glasgow. The code consists of an Android app in the frontend and a Node.js server with MongoDB in the backend.

To view the frontend code, please enter this directory. GPS_Shadow_Tracker_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/gps_shadow_tracker_app/

The frontend consists of 5 packages all written in Kotlin these include:
* game
* gps
* rest
* ui
* websocket

The main app is run from the MainActivity.kt file which initialises everything


To view the backend please follow the simpler to understand directory of GPS_Shadow_Tracker_Web_Node/
