# For the next week 18th October 2022

* Continue logging with the Kotlin Phone
* Research Multi Path Reflections and have a bit more background knowledge of how GPS works
* Write up the background knowledge
* Log some different places. Possible places include Duchess wood near Helensburgh and Glasgow City Center
* Look into what the accuracy numbers mean (in meters)
* Come up with ideas for a game

## If I have time
* Recreate the Kotlin app in React Native to compare to see what tech I would want to write up the code in
