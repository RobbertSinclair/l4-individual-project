Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
\section{Guidance}

\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

\section{Writing guidance}
\subsection{Who is the reader?}

This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
    \item
    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
    \item
    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
    \item
    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
    \emph{explain your project}.
    \item
    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
    strive for accuracy.}
    \item
    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
    irrelevant}.
\end{itemize}

Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

\subsection{References and style guides}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Citation styles}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Background}

In this chapter I will go over some of the foundational concepts required to understnad the background of the project

\section{Introduction to the Global Positioning System (GPS)}

The Global Positioning System also known as GPS is one of the worlds most famous GNSS systems. It allows people to determine their
location from anywhere around the world at any time. GPS has three main phases, the space phase, the control phase and the user phase.
In the space phase, the earth is split up into 24 "slots" which should be filled up by an operational satellite \citep{spsStandard}. Therefore
the GPS constellation is made up of at least 24 opterational satellites. In an ideal situation a user should have access to at least 4 of the satellites
at any one time \citep{Rabbany2006}. 

Each GPS satellite consistently sends down radio signals down to the Earth's surface. As of 2020 there are three main frequencies
these are L1 which emits at 1575.42 MHz, L2 which emits radio waves at 1227.6 MHz and L5 with 1176.45 MHz \citep{spsStandard}. This project
will most likely be using L2 and L1 as L5 is used mainly for aviation safety \citep{Xu2016} A GPS receiver will pick up this data and can use the satellite to calculate the distance from each satellite. Once a 
satellite distance is calculated we can create a radius of equidistant points. We can then add the signals from several other
satellites to find the intersection points. We usually need 3 to 4 satellites to be able to pinpoint the GPS receiver on the map. \citep{Rabbany2006}



%TODO - Add a source and paragraph about how GPS is calculated

\section{What causes Inaccuracies in GPS Systems}
In this project we will be looking at making a game based on GPS shadows which are areas where the GPS signal is not as accurate. In this section I will look
at the various factors that could effect our accuracy.

\subsection{GPS Clock Errors}
The first form of GPS error is a clock error.




\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item
      Don't give a laundry list of references.
    \item
      Tie everything you say to your problem.
    \item
      Present an argument.
    \item Think critically; weigh up the contribution of the background and put it in context.    
    \item
      \textbf{Don't write a tutorial}; provide background and cite
      references for further information.
\end{itemize}

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
In this section I go over the main process that I used to come up with a design for the game

\section{Creating an app to get GPS locations}
Since I didn't have much knowledge of mobile app development. I gathered that the best place to start was to make an app that gets a location. 
I started by doing some research into creating an Android app using Kotlin. The main aim of this app was to get me the latitude and longitude coordinates every second and most importantly, give me the accuracy for the GPS locations. 
In order to get this up and running quickly, I tested two main GeoLocation APIs, the FusedLocationProvider API and the LocationManger which can be found in the Android Documentation.

\subsection{FusedLocationProvider API}
The first API I tried was the FusedLocationProvider API as this was the first one that I found. The FusedLocationProvider API combines both GPS and WiFi geolocation
techniques to try and create an optimal location \citep{fused}. This API allowed me to create a basic location app quickly so that I could start finding GPS locations
within my local area. As figure \ref{fig:fusedhist} shows, the location data that I gathered was skewed towards values with an accuracy of less than 50. While a lot of
points were under the 20 meters area. However as you can see, there was a decent amount of values above 50 meters meaning that the API picked up a lot of shadows.
This API would have been a good one to use for my game as I would have had a lot of shadow areas for a player to hide. However the main flaw was that
it was giving me a combination of both Wifi and GPS coordinates. Thies meant that I was more likely to find shadows in areas with low WiFi. This would
explain why I had a lot of shadow areas when I walked around Kelvingrove Park, an area which I thought would have a very accurate signal due to the lack of buildings.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/fused_histogram.pdf}    

    \caption{Histogram showing the ranges of accuracy (in meters) of location points picked up by the FusedLocationProvider API}

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:fusedhist} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{LocationManger API}
Since the FusedLocationProvider wasn't appropriate for the project, I needed to find an API that would give me location data based purely on GPS. One of the libraries that I found
from the Android Developers Website was the "LocationManger" API. The LocationManager API gives me more control over what kind of Geolocation I was getting on my phone. Therefore
I was able to ensure that my geolocation was based on a full GNSS navigation system. \citep{locationManager} The other main advantage to this library is that with the use of the "requestLocationUpdates" method and
the "LocationListener" interface, I can easily control what my app does when it receives a new location.

While there are some advantages to using the LocationManager API, it does come with some disadvantages as well. For one thing, there are significantly less shadow areas when using
pure GNSS coordinates. The only real areas where there are major shadows are within buildins, under bridges or in enclosed areas. This is because on my phone, it can track up to 
15 satellites when getting my location. In comparison to figure \ref{fig:fusedhist}, figure \ref{fig:mongohist} shows that there is one big peak in the overall accuracy of all the spots.
When walking around with my app I noticed that for most of the time, my accuracy was 3.795 meters of accuracy. However while this may be a disadvantage the main advantage for creating a
game is that compared to the Fused Location API.

\section{Guidance}
Make it clear how you derived the constrained form of your problem via a clear and logical process. 

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
How is this problem to be approached, without reference to specific implementation details? 
\section{Guidance}
Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
What did you do to implement this idea, and what technical achievements did you make?
\section{Guidance}
You can't talk about everything. Cover the high level first, then cover important, relevant or impressive details.



\section{General points}

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
    }

    This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }
    
\caption{The Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from arbitrary probability distributions, 
specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise. 

\begin{table}[]
    \caption{The standard table of operators in Python, along with their functional equivalents from the \texttt{operator} package. Note that table
    captions go above the table, not below. Do not add additional rules/lines to tables. }\label{tab:operators}

\subsection{Code}

Avoid putting large blocks of code in the report (more than a page in one block, for example). Use syntax highlighting if possible, as in Listing \ref{lst:callahan}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, float, caption={The algorithm for packing the $3\times 3$ outer-totalistic binary CA successor rule into a 
    $16\times 16\times 16\times 16$ 4 bit lookup table, running an equivalent, notionally 16-state $2\times 2$ CA.}, label=lst:callahan]
    def create_callahan_table(rule="b3s23"):
        """Generate the lookup table for the cells."""        
        s_table = np.zeros((16, 16, 16, 16), dtype=np.uint8)
        birth, survive = parse_rule(rule)

        # generate all 16 bit strings
        for iv in range(65536):
            bv = [(iv >> z) & 1 for z in range(16)]
            a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p = bv

            # compute next state of the inner 2x2
            nw = apply_rule(f, a, b, c, e, g, i, j, k)
            ne = apply_rule(g, b, c, d, f, h, j, k, l)
            sw = apply_rule(j, e, f, g, i, k, m, n, o)
            se = apply_rule(k, f, g, h, j, l, n, o, p)

            # compute the index of this 4x4
            nw_code = a | (b << 1) | (e << 2) | (f << 3)
            ne_code = c | (d << 1) | (g << 2) | (h << 3)
            sw_code = i | (j << 1) | (m << 2) | (n << 3)
            se_code = k | (l << 1) | (o << 2) | (p << 3)

            # compute the state for the 2x2
            next_code = nw | (ne << 1) | (sw << 2) | (se << 3)

            # get the 4x4 index, and write into the table
            s_table[nw_code, ne_code, sw_code, se_code] = next_code

        return s_table

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/boxplot_finger_distance.pdf}    

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
