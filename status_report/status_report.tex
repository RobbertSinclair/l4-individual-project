\subsubsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}

%\emph{{[}Clearly motivate the purpose of your project; why someone would
%care about what you are doing{]}}

The Global Positioning System or GPS has had a huge impact on our daily lives. It helps us navigate around unfamiliar areas with ease. While GPS is accurate most of the time, there
are some areas like in buildings or under bridges where the accuracy can decrease. This is what we refer to as a GPS Shadow. Seamful design is the idea of making what might be
a problem or frustrating as a benefit to the product.

\item Created a Logging app which created a dataset of GPS Shadows around the Glasgow University Campus
\item Came up with some small designs of game ideas
\item Started to make 
\end{itemize}
